# MoneySpendingTracker
Web application for tracking spending


# Why I made this app
I tried several apps to track my spending and most of the time i found a couple of features missing and some times I want more charts than the given ones to show up a good overview to my spending
So I used excel for the past 4 months to explore more about what I want and then I am going to develop this app as a side proj.

# Technology Stack 
I use Angular for the Front-End and Kotlin for the backend and MySql for the Database
